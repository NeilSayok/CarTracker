# Car Locator App

This app checks the location of the car and shows its location and last update time on a map.

**For this app you will need a google map api key, which you need to place in CarLocatorUserSide1M/app/src/debug/res/values/google_maps_api.xml inside**

``` <string name="google_maps_key" templateMergeStrategy="preserve" translatable="false">YOUR GOOGLE MAPS API KEY HERE</string>```

Follow the instructions written in the file to get the api key or follow this [youtube link](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgCYzUzKIBE-vInwQhGSdnbyJ62nixHCt) to know how to get the api key (watch the first three videos).

In the apps java files or string.xml wherever there is "https://car-locator-javalab-proj.000webhostapp.com/" replace it by your website name where the php files have been uploaded.

Ex: In this repository inside "Car-Locator-System/CarLocatorUserSide1M/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml" there are links like:

**"https://car-locator-javalab-proj.000webhostapp.com/fetchLocation.php"**

make it:

**"https://your-example-site.com/fetchLocation.php"**

#### Dont forget to search in the java files too ðŸ˜‹.
